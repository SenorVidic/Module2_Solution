			<h1 class="a">Lamb</h1>
			<p>If you only buy lamb around the holidays, it's time to shake things up. The protein makes a great substitute if you're getting tired of a beef, chicken, or pork routine, and can be used in wraps or kebobs at a cookout. Of course, if you're getting ready for Easter, we've got plenty of show-stopping recipes for a crowd, too.</p>

	    <h1 class="b">Pork</h1>
		<p>Typically, bone-in pork chops are thicker than those with the bone removed. A thin pork chop is difficult to cook perfectly with this method, because of the hard sear you give both sides before it goes in the oven. If a chop is too thin, by the time you've seared both sides, the thing is practically overcooked! Choosing a thick chop allows you to get a nice golden sear on both sides and a perfectly cooked tender center.</p>

		<p>Cajun catfish served up with just the right touch of spices and flavor. This entree is perfect for a quick, excellent way to taste the unique flavor of catfish mixed with the traditional method of down south cooking, just without all the fat. Serve on top of white rice.</p>
